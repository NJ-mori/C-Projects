# -- C-Projects --

**Here you will find all of my personal projec that i made trying to learn c++ sorted by date.**

-Blackjack-

I wanted to try making something with randomness and i figured ou pretty soon that in c++ randomness is pretty much just like in C so it wasn't to hard i just needed to search online for only one line of code :

std::srand(static_cast<unsigned>(std::time(nullptr)));



-Converter-

I asked my friend that knows pretty well c++ what kind of projects i could do with my current knowledge of c and c++ (so without any struct/class) nad he told me that a converter could be a good idea to reinforce my effectiveness with functions, this project was pretty good since i really wanted to use a minimum of calculus and it worked great in the end.
