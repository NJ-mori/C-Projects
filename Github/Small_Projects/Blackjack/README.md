    Unfolding of the project :

    - Idea of Operation

        - intialize dealers and player cards with random int from 1 to 11.
        The player and the dealer need to have 4 to 21 points at the start of the program.

        - create a menu ;
        
        - ask what the player wants to do :

            if the player choose to HIT, add random number from 1 to 10 to his score (random card), then show him how many points he have and come back to menu. (if the player's point goes above 21, if so he lose instantly.)

            if the player choose to STAY, add random number from 1 to 10 to the dealer's score (random card) until the dealer have more points than the player. (unless the dealer goes above 21 point,if so the player wins.) + (not neccessary if the player gets 21 points.)

            if the player already has 21 points from the start he wins instantly.

            if the dealer already has 21 points from the start the player lose instantly.

        - show the result of the game.
